This is a task to create a Django project with an app called Bbug and commit it to GitHub.A virtual environment was created from a terminal and activated. Installation of Django was done using "pip" command and creation of Django project(Bugbug) using 'django-admin startproject' command.
As a newbie to Python, I found the link https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/ most helpful while working on this task.
